# Interface polish review format


Use `full` when no review mode is supplied.

| Mode | Coverage | Finding cap |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `quick` | Primary user path and highest-traffic states; report only `HIGH` and `MEDIUM` issues | 5 |
| `full` | Entire requested scope across typography, surfaces, animations, icons, and performance | 15 |

### Scope and Coverage

State the mode, exact scope, framework, styling conventions, and any review boundary. Show what was actually inspected:

| Category | Evidence inspected | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Typography | Files, components, states, or checks | Findings count, `Clear`, or `Not reviewed` with a reason |

Include all five Quick Reference categories. Never imply an uninspected surface was reviewed.

### Findings

Group findings by principle. Use a markdown table with **Severity**, **Location**, **Before**, **After**, and **Why** columns. Include every change made or proposed, not a subset. Never use separate "Before:" / "After:" lines.

- **Severity**: `HIGH` makes an interaction inaccessible, misleading, unreadable, or repeatedly disruptive; `MEDIUM` creates a noticeable usability or consistency problem; `LOW` is isolated polish and appears only in `full` mode.
- **Location**: cite `path/to/file:line`. If the artifact has no source files, cite the exact screen and component instead.
- **Before / After**: show the current implementation and an actionable replacement.
- **Why**: name the violated principle and explain its user impact.

Consolidate a repeated systemic issue into one row and list every affected location. Omit principles with no findings and never pad the report to reach the cap.

### Example

#### Concentric border radius
| Severity | Location | Before | After | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LOW | `src/Card.tsx:28` | `rounded-xl` on card + `rounded-xl` on inner button (`p-2`) | `rounded-2xl` on card (`8 + 8 = 16`), `rounded-lg` on inner button | Nested corners should be concentric |
| LOW | `src/card.css:11` | `border-radius: 16px` on both nested surfaces | Outer `24px`, inner `16px` with `8px` padding | Equal nested radii make the inner surface look pinched |

#### Tabular numbers
| Severity | Location | Before | After | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MEDIUM | `src/Counter.tsx:17` | `<span>{count}</span>` | `<span className="tabular-nums">{count}</span>` | Proportional digits cause changing values to shift |
| LOW | `src/timer.css:8` | Default numerals on a timer | Add `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` to the timer | Equal-width digits keep the timer stable |

#### Scale on press
| Severity | Location | Before | After | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LOW | `src/Button.tsx:19` | `<button className="...">` | Add `active:scale-[0.96] transition-transform` | Press feedback makes the control feel responsive |
| MEDIUM | `src/button.css:24` | `scale(0.9)` on press | Raise to `scale(0.96)` | Anything below `0.95` feels exaggerated |

### Considered but Rejected

Include 1–3 real candidates in `quick` mode and 2–5 in `full` mode:

| Location | Candidate | Rejected because |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/Card.tsx:28` | Increase the shadow | Existing depth matches the shared surface token; changing one card would reduce consistency |

Do not invent filler. If the scope contains fewer borderline candidates, include the ones that exist and say so.

### Verification and Verdict

After the findings:

1. **Verification**: list the exact commands or interactions run and their observed results. Walk every relevant state and inspect motion at 10% speed when animation is involved. If a check was not run, label it **Not verified** and state what remains.
2. **Verdict**: `Block` if any `HIGH` finding remains, `Needs changes` if only `MEDIUM` or `LOW` findings remain, and `Approve` only when no actionable findings remain. List every unverified check beside the verdict.

When there are no findings, omit the findings table, state "No actionable interface-polish findings", report verification and rejected candidates, and end with `Approve`.
